## 🔬 Training Methodology

### 1. Transfer Learning Strategy

**Two-Phase Training Approach**:

**Phase 1: Head Warmup (Epochs 1-3)**

- Freeze backbone (EfficientNet-B3 pre-trained layers)
- Train only classification head
- Purpose: Adapt final layers to food recognition task
- Learning Rate: 1×10⁻³

**Phase 2: Fine-tuning (Epochs 4-24)**

- Unfreeze entire network
- Train all layers with lower learning rate
- Purpose: Fine-tune feature extractors for food-specific patterns
- Learning Rate: 1×10⁻⁴ (10× reduction)

**Why This Approach?**

- Prevents catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained features
- Faster convergence compared to training from scratch
- Better generalization on limited dataset

---

### 2. Data Augmentation Techniques

**Purpose**: Artificially increase dataset diversity to improve generalization.

**Training Augmentations Applied**:

| Augmentation             | Parameters                                            | Purpose                              |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **RandomResizedCrop**    | scale=(0.7, 1.0)                                      | Simulate different camera distances  |
| **RandomHorizontalFlip** | p=0.5                                                 | Handle left-right symmetry           |
| **RandomRotation**       | ±20°                                                  | Account for camera tilt              |
| **ColorJitter**          | brightness=0.3, contrast=0.3, saturation=0.3, hue=0.1 | Simulate lighting variations         |
| **RandomAffine**         | translate=(0.1, 0.1)                                  | Handle slight camera shifts          |
| **RandomErasing**        | p=0.2, scale=(0.02, 0.15)                             | Simulate occlusions (e.g., utensils) |

**Validation/Test Preprocessing**:

- Resize to 284×284 pixels

### 3. Regularization Techniques

**Purpose**: Prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.

#### A. Mixup Data Augmentation

- **Algorithm**: Blend two training images and their labels
- **Formula**:
  ```
  mixed_image = λ × image_A + (1-λ) × image_B
  mixed_label = λ × label_A + (1-λ) × label_B
  where λ ~ Beta(0.2, 0.2)
  ```
- **Effect**: Forces model to learn more robust features
- **Parameter**: α = 0.2

#### B. Label Smoothing

- **Purpose**: Prevent overconfident predictions
- **Formula**:
  ```
  smoothed_label = (1 - ε) × one_hot_label + ε/num_classes
  where ε = 0.1
  ```
- **Effect**: Improves calibration and generalization

#### C. Dropout

- **Rate**: 30% (p=0.3)
- **Location**: Before final classification layer
- **Effect**: Prevents co-adaptation of neurons

#### D. Weight Decay (L2 Regularization)

- **Rate**: 1×10⁻⁴
- **Effect**: Penalizes large weights, promotes simpler models

### 4. Training Configuration

| Hyperparameter    | Value              | Rationale                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Optimizer**     | AdamW              | Adaptive learning rates + weight decay  |
| **Learning Rate** | 1×10⁻³ → 1×10⁻⁴    | High warmup, lower fine-tuning          |
| **Batch Size**    | 16                 | Balance memory and gradient stability   |
| **Epochs**        | 50 (stopped at 24) | Early stopping prevented overfitting    |
| **Loss Function** | Cross-Entropy      | Standard for multi-class classification |
| **LR Scheduler**  | Cosine Annealing   | Smooth learning rate decay              |

---

### 5. Early Stopping

**Purpose**: Automatically stop training when model stops improving.

**Configuration**:

- **Patience**: 15 epochs
- **Metric**: Validation Top-1 Accuracy
- **Result**: Training stopped at epoch 24 (best: epoch 24)

**Why It Matters**:

- Prevents overfitting to training data
- Saves computational resources
- Ensures best model is used for deployment
